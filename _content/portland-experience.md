# We're commandeering a 3-block section of the downtown Park Blocks and taking the best of Portland and bringing it directly to you. So what exactly does this look like? Let us show you.

### World Famous Food Carts

Portland has been on the forefront of the food cart scene for the last decade. Why pay three times as much for similar quality food when you can order it from a cart?

At the Portland Experience we’ll have six of our favorite carts in the city on hand to allow you to sample foods from each, and get a better idea of why food carts are such an important part of the food scene in town.

### A Drink a Day

What good is food without something nice to wash it down with?

Portland is often referred to as “Beer City USA” because it has more breweries within it’s city limits than anywhere else in the country. We’ve partnered with a few of the best breweries in town to give you a little taste of what the city has to offer.

Along with that there will be wine tastings from three urban wineries, hard cider from one of the most successful cideries in Oregon, as well as local coffee and tea to be sampled as well.

Each business takes pride in what they do, so along with samples they’ll be on hand to talk about the specifics of each drink and the story behind it.

### There’s An Artist in All of Us

Portland has become known not only for it’s entrepreneurial spirit, but also for it’s large focus on arts, crafts, and creativity.

As such we want to give you an opportunity to create something yourself. We’ve partnered with a few local craft organizations and will be giving you a chance to make a variety of items in the spirit of “community, adventure, and service.”

### Give it a Little Stretch

Over the last couple years “Yoga Rocks the Park” has been making a name for itself across the country. Well we’ve partnered with them to host an hour long yoga session right within the confines of the Portland Experience.  

Have some food, have a drink, make something cool, and then prepare for our afternoon session with a little stretching and exercise.

With this new aspect of WDS we’re hoping to do more than just show you what Portland is all about—we want you to experience it.

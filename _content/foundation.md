# The WDS Foundation seeks to put the right resources in the hands of amazing people who are acting on the three core values of WDS—community, adventure, service. 

We do this by providing what we call “Scholarships For Real Life.” The goal of these scholarships is to empower individuals to pursue their dreams and impact their community. 

Have a crazy project you want to bring to life? Want to take a trip around the earth and share what you learned with the world? Trying to build something that’s a bit out of your reach? Whatever it is, the WDS Foundation can help fund it. We look for inspiring projects that will improve your life *and* make the world a better place.

### Eligibility

For our first year of the “Scholarships for Real Life” program, we’re opening the application only to those who have attended or will be attending a World Domination Summit. As the program progresses, we intend to open this up to a wider audience—so check back next year if you’re note currently eligible.

# How to Play the Unconvential Race

### Welcome!

Congratulations! You're about to embark on the race of a lifetime that will have you meeting other attendees, experiencing Portland, and perhaps doing a few things you weren't expecting to do during your time here.

In order to qualify for the big prizes, there are a few things you need to know.
First off, there are three types of tasks:

### Automatic Tasks 

With automatic tasks, you'll get awarded points simply for meeting people on the WDS.fm site.  For instance, you'll get one race point for every five people you "meet" through the interface.

These must be mutual, so you need to have both met each other in the system.

### Photo Upload Tasks

Most of the items are "photo upload" tasks.  That means that in order to get awarded points, you'll have to upload a photo via the race interface.  

### Video Tasks

For these, you'll need to submit a video via your device instead of a photo. 

If you're unable to upload a video for any reason, submit a picture and we'll verify you have video proof if in the Top 3 at the end of the race.

If you didn't record a video, please don't check off the task, it's not fair for everyone else, and will just take more time during verification.

### Photo/Video Uploading

As long as you're using an iPhone running iOS6 or an Android phone made in the past few years, uploading couldn't be easier!

#### Here's what you do:

In the task list, tap the upload photo button. It looks like this:
div(class="send-race icon icon-picture") 

This will open up an panel with options to either take a photo or browse your current gallery.

Take a picture or select a photo you've already taken. It may take some time to finish uploading but
once you return to WDS.fm your points and rank will be updated!

#### Very Important:

We will be picking out the most creative photos each day and awarding extra points! Do your best to make your photos as creative as possible.

### Honor System

Much of the race, up until verification, is based on the honor system - so be cool.  

Don't cross things off you haven't done.  Don't "meet" people you didn't actually meet, and let's make this fair and fun for everyone.

### Most Important
Have fun.  This is meant to enhance your experience here at WDS.  Don't stress about it, just enjoy yourself.

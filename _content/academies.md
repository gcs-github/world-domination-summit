# For attendees that come early and leave late, we'll have some incredible learning opportunities to take their WDS experience to the next level

<div class="zig-zags_blue"></div>

When reviewing WDS 2013, we noticed something - more and more attendees are coming to Portland early and leaving later so they can prolong the time they have with their fellow WDSers.

We decided to arrange academies during the day before and after WDS so you can really make the most of your time here.

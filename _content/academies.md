## Academies

# As WDS grows, more and more people are arriving early and staying late. This year marks the launch of WDS Academies: a series of mini-events focused on specific topics that take place on the days surrounding WDS weekend. 

Registration for Academies is separate from WDS itself. We'll offer registration for the academies first to WDS attendees, and then (for a slightly higher price) to the general public.

	<a href="#"><h4>Nerd Fitness Day Camp</h4></a>
	<h5>9:00 am–4:00 pm</h5>
	Led by Steve Kamb
	<a href="#" class="button">Register</a>
	<div class="collapsable-content">
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		Whether you’re interested in learning strength training, yoga, parkour, becoming a better runner, or just spending a long weekend with friends you’ve gotten to know through the Nerd Fitness community, we’ve got you covered. It's kind of like a combination having fun with friends and learning new things about fitness and health.  This will not be a rigorous, intensive exercise all-day bootcamp, nor will it be a typical seminar where you sit in one room all day and listen to people talk for 10 hours.

		<h4>About Steve Kamb</h4>
		Steve is NOT a fitness expert. Although he obtained a basic personal training certification from AAAI a few years back, and has dedicated the past decade of his life to this stuff, his perspective comes from a normal guy down in the trenches with you – a nerd who sits at a computer all day long, loves to play video games, and really enjoys staying active while pushing himself to be in the best shape he can be.

	<a href="#"><h4>Making Art and Giving It Away</h4></a>
	<h6>9:00 am–4:00 pm</h6>
	Led by Gary Hirsch
	<a href="#" class="button">Register</a>
	<div class="collapsable-content">
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		This is a big, fun exploration of collaboration: how to do more of it, how to invite others into your work, what not to do. It will also be the launch of a co-creative art/story project by Gary Hirsch where participants take (literally) original artwork from the artist and use it as a launch pad for their own art, work, and stories.

In the session you'll play, collaborate, tell stories, get some free cool stuff, work with strangers, and let go a bit, which is always a good thing. This is a great session to get help with something that you are currently working on, and have a ridiculously good time!

		<h4>About Gary Hirsch</h4>
		Gary Hirsch is a collaboration junkie and the co-founder of [On Your Feet](http://oyf.com), a consultancy that uses improvisation and other interactive methods to help organizations generate new ideas, collaborate, engage audiences and walk their talk. After improv, Gary’s second love is art making, which is rooted in collaboration as well. Currently he is obsessed with making and launching thousands of small hand-painted domino robots into the world to see what will happen. Story telling, improvisation, and doodling are all inter-related for Gary, when he’s doing any of these there are never enough hours in the day.

	<a href="#"><h4>The Art of Simple: A Field Guide to Redesigning Your Simple Life</h4></a>
	<h5>1:00 pm–5:00 pm</h5>
	Led by Tsh Oxenreider
	<a href="#" class="button">Register</a>
	<div class="collapsable-content">
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		Just what is “simple living,” anyway? And why does it seem to hard to… well, do? Conventional culture often defines living simply with a bunch of rules: shun the TV, ride only your bike, grow your own food, shower only when others complain. But the real definition is delightfully freeing, and it can be fleshed out in any lifestyle, at any age, at any place in the world. In this workshop, we’ll explore what living simply might look like for you. First, we’ll relish in the real definition of simple living. Then, you’ll find time and space to deconstruct parts of your life, followed by freedom to reassemble them using a new-to-you blueprint. Roll up your sleeves and treat yourself to a morning/an afternoon of personal reflection, brainstorming, and if you want, a chance to bounce around some fresh ideas on the nuts and bolts of making it all work. (Introverts who thrive on solo reflection are just as welcome as extroverts who need to chat it all out.) Bring your journal and a pencil for this one.

		<h4>About Tsh Oxenreider</h4>
		Tsh Oxenreider is passionate about people living simply so that others can simply live, and also firmly believes that a passport is one of life's greatest textbooks. She's the author of three books, including the new "Notes From a Blue Bike: The Art of Living Intentionally in a Chaotic World," and is the founder and chief spearheader of TheArtofSimple.net, a community blog about simple living. Tsh and her family travel frequently, but right now they live in beautiful Bend, Oregon.

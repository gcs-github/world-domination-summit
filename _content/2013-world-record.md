## 2013 World Record

# The World Float was, in a word, epic. 620 people on the Willamette River, holding hands and having a blast. Could you ask for more? We did. Can we get a world record up in here?

In 2013, 3,000 people descended on Portland for the 3rd Annual World Domination Summit. With so many amazing folks coming to town, we wanted to find a way to bring our attendees and Portlanders together to accomplish something truly spectacular. And we did just that in the creation of a world record attempt!

Did you know you could be recorded in the history books just by sitting in an inner tube and holding hands with a few friends? Neither did we. That is, until we learned of 542 folks in Italy who did it in 2008, setting the record for the "World's Longest Floating Chain."

And now, thanks to the help of 620 amazing people, we broke that record and set our own. But the record wasn't the only thingâ€”it was all for a great cause, too. In the spirt of WDS and our commitment to service, we partnered with The Human Access Project, a local non-profit working to give Portlanders more opportunities to get in the river, just like we did.

## Attendee Stories

# In addition to the great speakers we have lined up for main stage sessions, we're handing the mic over to attendees more than ever this year. 

<div class="zig-zags_blue"></div>

As we have done for the past several years, we will feature stories from the WDS community that can be told in impactful bite-size tales that are 2 minutes or less. If you have a story you would like to share with the WDS community in 2 minutes or less, please let us know by submitting a proposal here:

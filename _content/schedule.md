<p class="intro">We'll all arrive in the city for a welcoming party on Friday evening, July 11th. The main event kicks off in the beautiful Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall on Saturday morning.</p>

Throughout both weekend days, we'll alternate between the main stage for speaker talks, nearby alternate spaces for smaller-group workshops, and several smaller spaces for impromptu meetups.The evenings will find us set loose on the town, attending your choice of Portland group events.

We'll conclude on Sunday evening in time for red-eye flights to the East Coast, or you can head out on another group event or stay for a Farewell party that goes as long as people are around. If you never need to sleep, afterparties and early-morning parties are scheduled for each day.

### Main Stage

<a name="main-stage"></a>

<img src="/images/schedule/schedule-circle-1.png" id="schedule-circle-1"/>

We'll begin each morning in the Schnitzer Theatre, a beautiful auditorium where no seat is further than 60 feet from the stage. Speakers will share a short message that combines personal stories with practical ideas.

During breaks, you can visit the Hang-Out Hammock Lounge for a quick snooze—or just catch up with a new friend over a cup of coffee.

Most presentations will devote at least 25% of the time to audience Q&A. Most speakers will also be available in 
smaller workshop sessions to spend even more time with informal conversation.

<h3 class="color-green">Workshops</h3>

<a name="workshops"></a>

After we end in the main theatre each day, we'll head to breakout rooms of smaller groups for specific topics. You can choose from topics such as these:

* Travel Hacking Anywhere in the World

* How to Get a Book Deal

* $100 Startup Entrepreneurship Group

* How to Work Overseas

* Yoga on the Lawn

* Become a Better Photographer in 
60 Minutes

<p class="color-green">Note: Workshops are available on a first-come, first-served basis. We'll also have yoga in the park (everyone's welcome) and other activities which are available to all attendees.</p>

<h3 class="color-orange">Everything Else</h3>

We'll begin each morning in the Schnitzer Theatre, a beautiful auditorium where no seat is further than 60 feet from the stage. Speakers will share a short message that combines personal stories with practical ideas.

<h4 class="color-orange">Blogger Meetups</h3>

Both days, we'll set aside time for bloggers to host informal meetups. You can go from the Get Rich Slowly meetup to the Location Independent meetup—and then over to the Minimalist group, where a fight will likely break out over who owns the fewest things.

And if you have your own blog, you can host a meetup too. (An e-bulletin board will tell attendees where each meetup is being held.)

	<p>
		On Sunday night—before we all head to the afterparty—we've set aside a space for our speakers to sign books and meet readers. Print books will be available for sale, and if you're digital-only, you can stop by to say hi to your favorite author.

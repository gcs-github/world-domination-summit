<p class="intro">We'll all arrive in the city for registration on Friday afternoon and an opening party on Friday evening. The main event kicks off in the beautiful Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall on Saturday morning.</p>

Throughout both weekend days, we'll alternate between the main stage for speaker talks, a park area for a mini-festival, and several smaller spaces for attendee-led meetups. The evenings will find us set loose on the town, attending your choice of group events or just out on your own.

We'll conclude on Sunday evening with a Farewell party that goes as long as people are around. If you never need to sleep, afterparties and early-morning parties are scheduled for each day. For the first time this year, additional "Academies" will be held on the days before and after the weekend.

### Main Stage

<a name="main-stage"></a>

<img src="/images/schedule/schedule-circle-1.png" id="schedule-circle-1"/>

We'll begin each morning in the Schnitzer Theatre, a beautiful auditorium where no seat is further than 60 feet from the stage. Speakers will share a short message that combines personal stories with practical ideas.

During breaks, you can visit the Hang-Out Hammock Lounge for a quick snooze—or just catch up with a new friend over a cup of coffee.

Most speakers will attend the entire weekend and be available for informal conversation.

<h3 class="color-green">Portland Experience</h3>

<a name="portland-experience"></a>

After morning sessions end on Saturday, we're taking over the Park Blocks for a festival format. The all-new "Portland Experience" features:

*Beer and wine tastings

*Hour-long yoga session with guest DJ

*Demonstrations from local vendors

*Interactive arts and crafts

<p class="color-green">**Note:** Need a break? Our Highly-Sensitive Person zone will be open all afternoon. You can also attend your choice of 100+ attendee-led gatherings.</p>

<h3 class="color-orange">Everything Else</h3>

<h4 class="color-orange">Attendee Meetups</h3>

<p></p>
<p>Both days, we'll set aside time for attendees to host informal meetups. You can go from the Get Rich Slowly meetup to the Location Independent meetup—and then over to the Minimalist group, where a fight will likely break out over who owns the fewest things.</p>
<p>And if you have your own blog, you can host a meetup too. (Our dedicated attendee web app will tell you where each meetup is being held.)</p>

<div class="half-col">
	<h4 class="color-orange">Meet the Authors</h3>
	<p></p>
	<p>On Sunday afternoon—before we all head to the afterparty—we've set aside a space for our speakers to sign books and meet readers. Print books will be available for sale throughout the weekend, and if you're digital-only, you can stop by to say hi to your favorite author.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="half-col">
	<h4 class="color-orange">See the city</h3>
	<p></p>
	<p>Head out to see the town on your choice of self-guided walking tours in cooperation with other attendees. Tours will begin on Thursday night (prior to the official opening) and continue through the following Monday.

<h3>Your Base in Portland, Oregon</h3>
<p>
	We'll base out of the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, located two blocks from a light-rail stop and directly across from South Park. On Saturday morning, one of the city's main Farmer's Markets will be open in the park, with cupcakes, fresh vegetables, and local art available for sale.

<p>For all of these options, Portland's fast-and-easy light rail service goes directly from the airport to downtown for $2.30 - no need to rent a car during your whole time in the city. You can also come a day early or stay a day late, and the discount hotel rates are valid during the entire week surrounding the summit.</p>

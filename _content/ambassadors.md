## Ambassadors

# Nearly 3,000 attendees from dozens of countries are coming to Portland for the fourth annual World Domination Summit in July. Want to help?

Our entire team is composed of volunteers and has been working for a year to prepare. For the big weekend, we’ll be recruiting additional help. You’ll work directly with the WDS organizers in serving our attendees by making them feel welcome and ensuring that everything runs smoothly. Rewards include fame, pizza, and your very own Ambassador t-shirt! 

**You must be available the entire weekend of July 11-13 and for an orientation on Monday, July 7th.**

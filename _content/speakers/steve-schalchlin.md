### A bit more about Steve

After being given a year to live with HIV/AIDS, he wrote Connected about his visit to an ER; how his friends’ love kept him alive. The music brought him strength and gave birth to his Off-Broadway and London hit musical, "The Last Session."

Steve is a pioneering blogger, has lectured at Harvard and Stanford Universities, and was featured in *The New York Times*, *People* and on MSNBC. George Michael honored Steve, including him in a documentary playing his music on John Lennon’s IMAGINE piano.

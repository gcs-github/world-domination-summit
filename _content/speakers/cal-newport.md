# "The path to a passionate life is often way more complex than the simple advice 'follow your passion' would suggest." Cal argues that this common saying is astonishingly wrong.

Cal Newport is a writer and an assistant professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University. In his writing, Newport applies a systematic approach to decoding patterns of success.

His first three books, published by Random House, focused on the world of students, offering unconventional, evidence-based approaches to succeeding in school (hint: do less). His fourth book, which argues that “follow your passion” is bad career advice, will be published by Hachette this fall.

# Bob Moore is passionate about whole grains and investing in his employees. He shared his story about creating Bob's Red Mill and how important it is to put people before profit.

**Bob Moore’s** journey began serendipitously in the mid 1960s after coming across a book about old stone-grinding flour mills. His enthusiasm was immediate. Equipped with several sets of millstones from an old North Carolina water- powered flour mill, Bob and his wife, Charlee, began their first mill in Redding, California.

### A bit more about Bob

After a few years, they decided to pursue others interests and retired to Oregon City, Oregon in 1978. On an afternoon walk, Bob came across an old mill that, as luck would have it, had a big sign out front reading “for sale”. In just a few short months, he was grinding flours and cereals for local customers. Bob spent many years growing the business, which is currently located in Milwaukie, Oregon in a 320,000 square foot facility covering some seventeen acres and producing thousands of products.

Bob’s 81st birthday was particularly special. Rather than receiving gifts, he decided to give his greatest gift away—his business. Bob surprised all his employees by giving them total ownership of Bob’s Red Mill.

### A bit more about Michael

Michael is the former Chairman & CEO of Thomas Nelson Publishers, the largest faith-based publisher in the world and now part of HarperCollins. He began his career at Word Publishing while a senior at Baylor University. In the 30 years since then, he has worked in nearly every facet of book publishing.

He is also an expert in the field of social media. His blog, [MichaelHyatt.com](http://michaelhyatt.com), is ranked by Google in the top one-half percent of all blogs with more than 350,000 unique visitors a month. He has readers in more than two hundred countries.

His podcast, This Is Your Life, is consistently in the top ten in the Business category on iTunes and downloaded by more than 300,000 people a month. He has more than 200,000 followers on Twitter.

While Michael loves his work, it is not the most important thing in his life. That position belongs to his family. He has been married to his wife, Gail for thirty-four years. They have five daughters, four sons-in-law, and eight grandchildren. They live just outside of Nashville, Tennessee.

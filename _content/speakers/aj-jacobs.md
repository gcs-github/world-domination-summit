**A.J. Jacobs** is a human guinea pig and the author of four New York Times bestsellers. Among them, *The Year of Living Biblically*, about his quest to follow the hundreds of rules in the Bible, and *Drop Dead Healthy*, about his project to become the healthiest person in the world.

He has also outsourced his life, lived by the rules of George Washington, and read the *Encyclopedia Britannica* from A to Z. He is the Editor at Large at *Esquire* magazine and a regular contributor to NPR.

His next project is to hold the Largest Family Reunion in history. You are invited. Because the truth is, we are all cousins.

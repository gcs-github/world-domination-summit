**Sarah Lewis** has served on President Barack Obama’s Arts Policy Committee, been selected for Oprah’s “Power List,” and is a faculty member at Yale University, School of Art in the MFA program. She received her bachelor’s degree from Harvard University, an M. Phil from Oxford University, and just received her Ph.D. from Yale University in March 2014.

Her debut book, *The Rise: Creativity, the Gift of Failure, and the Search for Mastery* was just released by Simon & Schuster U.S., HarperCollins U.K. (March 2014) and has sold translation rights in Brazil, Holland, Thailand, and South Korea to date. *The Rise* is a layered, story-driven investigation of how innovation, discovery, and the creative progress are all spurred on by advantages gleaned from the improbable, the unlikely, even failure. 

Her second book, based on her Yale dissertation, *Black Sea, Black Atlantic: Frederick Douglass, The Circassian Beauties, and American Racial Formation in the Wake of the Civil War*, will be released by Harvard University Press in 2015. 

Her essays on contemporary art have been published widely in journals such as *Callaloo*, *Artforum*, and *Art in America*, and in publications including Rizzoli, the Smithsonian, The Museum of Modern Art and the Studio Museum in Harlem. She has held positions at both the Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. 

She is currently a board member of The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the CUNY Graduate Center, and The Brearley School. She lives in New York City.

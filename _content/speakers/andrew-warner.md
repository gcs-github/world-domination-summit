### A bit more about Andrew

After building a successful company, he became so arrogant about his entrepreneurial abilities that he started a $300,000 company that failed. Humbled, he decided to interview as many successful business founders as possible in order to learn from them. He published his interviews online so other entrepreneurs could learn along with him.

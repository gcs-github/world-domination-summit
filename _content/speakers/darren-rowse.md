## 2013 Speaker

# The original Problogger, Darren Rowse arrived from Australia with his team of Aussie empire builders. He also challenged us to lead an unconventional life and follow a dream… from zero to hero.

In 2002, **Darren Rowse** started his first ever blog, not knowing that what would start as a personal hobby site would grow into a full time profession and business. Since that time, Darren has been involved in publishing numerous blogs but now focuses his time editing Digital Photography School and ProBlogger.

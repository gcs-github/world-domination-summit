# Ticket sales for WDS 2014 are now closed. But wait... all is not lost!

Thanks for your interest in taking over the world. WDS tickets go very quickly, and we're completely sold out of tickets for the 2014 main event.

However! Even though the main event is now closed, we'll be opening public registraiton for a series of "Academies" that will take place before and after WDS weekend. As soon as those details are ready, we'll post them here. 

Oh, and you can also join us for our <a href="http://yogarecord.eventbrite.com">2014 World Record Attempt</a>. Bring friends and family!

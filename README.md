## Overview

As of WDS 2014, all content on the WDS site is managed right here from GitHub. 

You can easily create and edit pages from GitHub's interface, hit save and your changes are instantly sent to the WDS server and made live.

A page is created just by typing normally - text can be styled with either Markdown (super-easy and explained more below) or normal HTML.

Every change you make is tracked so if any problems occur, you can always roll back.

The guide below explains all the details of how this system works.

## Managing Content

### Creating a File

Let's get started!

To create a file you'll first want to click into the `_content` file. This is the file where *all* content pages should be. The only other file you may need is `_sidebars` - you can ignore all other files listed.


![The _content folder is important](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s10/sh/571149cc-b6e5-4b8e-8c13-f2e1208558b0/abfdb283c302da807a238ff8c5d2d37c/res/10aeff6c-b68e-4aae-b096-3f668826ff80/skitch.png?resizeSmall&width=832)


Once in the `_content` directory, click the small page-with-a-plus icon to create a new file there.

Now you're in the GitHub text editor, nice work so far!

The first task is to name your file in the textbox that says "Name your file..."

![Name your file here](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s10/sh/790ef366-36f4-481a-9f8a-05d218727d0a/b6a24e6f91ee898163b9492b8d6c5685/res/e0f35281-1221-4bd6-b240-2cf605989f63/skitch.png?resizeSmall&width=832)

**Important**: The name of your file should always end in `.md` (as in: MarkDown)

**Also Important**: The name you give your file is what the path will ultimately be. It should be all lowercase and use plain dashes instead of spaces.

So, if create a file called: dont-stop-believin.md, that will create a page at http://worlddominationsummit.com/dontstopbelievin

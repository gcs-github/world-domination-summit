## Overview

As of WDS 2014, all content on the WDS site is managed right here from GitHub. 

You can easily create and edit pages from GitHub's interface, hit save and your changes are instantly sent to the WDS server and made live.

A page is created just by typing normally - text can be styled with either Markdown (super-easy and explained more below) or normal HTML.

Every change you make is tracked so if any problems occur, you can always roll back.

The guide below explains all the details of how this system works.
